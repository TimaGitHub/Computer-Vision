## ðŸ“‚ **Repository Structure**  

The repository is organized into folders based on major topics in **Computer Vision**:

| Folder Name               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auto-Encoders**         | Papers and code implementations for auto-encoders (dimensionality reduction). |
| **CNNs**                  | Classical architectures such as LeNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.     |
| **Detection-Segmentation**| Models and techniques for image detection and segmentation (e.g., UNet).   |
| **Diffusion**             | Code and research on diffusion models for image generation.                |
| **GANs**                  | Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with code implementations.          |
| **Normalising-Flows**     | Research and examples of normalizing flow models for generative tasks.     |
